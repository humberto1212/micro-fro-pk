In this repository, my objective is to immerse myself in the world of micro frontends, harnessing the capabilities of vite-plugin-federation. My approach is fundamentally practical, driven by the desire to showcase the creation of multiple micro frontends in action.

I've taken the initiative to develop distinct micro frontends as part of my project. One of these micro frontends takes the form of a list, allowing me to tangibly demonstrate how vite-plugin-federation can be leveraged. Additionally, I've conceptualized a micro frontend that embodies a layout structure, serving as a prime example of how the framework empowers me to establish consistent visual themes and arrangements. It's important to note that I intentionally refrained from incorporating specific functionalities or stylings into these examples. This decision underscores my focus on the integration aspects of micro frontends.

At the core of my efforts lies the creation of a host micro frontend. This host acts as a pivotal component, seamlessly weaving together the various micro frontends into a unified and seamless user experience.
